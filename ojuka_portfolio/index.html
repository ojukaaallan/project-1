<h2><sup><i>01</i></sup>ABOUT ME</h2>
<div class="content-box">
<P>Through my career I plan to launch technology education programs that train young people and entrepreneurs at coding boot camps. A generation that can spearhead Africa's digital revolution should result from training people to work with digital tools as well as automate business operations and develop their technology solutions. Africa is at a turning point. The appropriate technological foundation enables this region to convert its current inefficient state into innovative systems that speed up economic development. My dedication lies in embracing this transformational process through computer science development that will solve issues while creating millions of opportunities. Through innovation along with education and ethical leadership, I will serve an Africa that enables technology to empower all citizens to achieve their maximum potential.</P>

<P>
<dl>
<dt><h3>a) INCOMING FRESHMAN African Leadership College of Higher Education (ALCHE), Mauritius</h3></dt>
<dd><b> Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Computer Science, </b> Numerous opportunities exist throughout Africa yet inadequate system processes create barriers to development. Modern institutions and organizations in healthcare together with education as well as agriculture and finance face obstacles in growth because their outdated fragmented systems restrict productivity and development. Computer science education will give me the capabilities to design efficient digital solutions that address systemic inefficiencies in various fields. For example, Platform-based health information storage can enable quick, dependable patient data retrieval, cutting down treatment delays and enhancing medical success rates. Additionally, medical resource allocation could become more efficient through machine learning hospital predictions, leading to increased saving of lives.</dd>
<dt><h3><b>b) POWER LEARN PEROJECT</h3></b></dt>
<dd>As a learner in the Power Learn Project's Software Development program, I am acquiring practical, industry-relevant skills in full-stack development, mobile applications, and software engineering principles. The program emphasizes hands-on learning through real-world projects, team collaboration, and mentorship. Through this experience, I'm building strong foundations in Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, databases, version control, and cloud technologies. PLP's Africa-focused approach also empowers me to use tech for impact, innovation, and entrepreneurship across the continent.</dd>
<dt><h3><b>c) ORERO BOYS Highschool</h3></b></dt>
<dd><b>Grade A- (class of Valedictorian) 2023</b>
I am a highly motivated and results-driven student pursuing degrees in Finance, Economics, and Computer Science. My diverse academic background equips me with a unique blend of analytical, problem-solving, and technical skills. Achieving an A- in high school reflects my dedication to academic excellence and continuous learning. I am passionate about leveraging my knowledge to solve complex challenges across multiple industries, from financial markets to technological advancements.</dd>
